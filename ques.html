    <ol>
        <li> What are access modifiers? Name them :<br>
            specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class. PUBLIC, private, protected... but in ts, protected is not there</li>
        <li> What are directives ? Types? Name some built in directives?   :<br>  classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. DOM manipulation, type : component, structural, attribute...built in : ngstyle, ngclasses, ngmodel  </li>
        <li>Class vs interface ?  :<br> objects of classes can be created, objects cant be created in interface... in class, interface can only be implemented using the keyword implement  </li>
        <li>Various components of angular?<br> A component is a combination of view and backing logic
            app.component.ts provides backing logic, app.component.html and app.component.css files provide look and feel of app component
        </li>
        <li>What are dependencies and where are they present in angular? :<br> 2 dependencies , development and production, development dependencies are packages which need during local development and testing time, production dependies are needed in production phase   </li>
        <li>DOM in javascript? :<br> Document Object Model, in browser, html is converted into DOM </li>
        <li>What are components? _____   </li>
        <li>Class vs components? <br> A module in Angular 2 is something which is made from components, directives, services etc. One or many modules combine to make an Application. Modules breakup application into logical pieces of code. Each module performs a single task. Components in Angular 2 are classes where you write your logic for the page you want to display. Components control the view (html). Components communicate with other components and services.  </li>
        <li>What are constructors? :<br> constructors are used to initialise the state of an object when object is being created </li>
        <li>What is polymorphism?  :<br> Polymorphism is the ability to create a class that has more than one form. </li>
        <li>Function overloading vs function overriding? :<br> |?|?||?|?|?|  </li>
        <li>Why should we use angular? :<br> it is scalable, fixed component pattern, components can be reused.. and 2 way data binding  </li>
        <li>How to generate class and interface in angular :<br> |?|?|?|?|?| </li>
        <li>Advantages of using nodejs :<br> it is asynchronous, tasks can be done parallely, doesn't wait for other to finish,, provides runtime environment js, event driven approach</li>
        <li>Working of node js? <br> |?|?|?|?|?</li>
        <li>What are functions? <br>|?|?|?|?|</li>
        <li>Where can we run javascript ? :<br> in node js, browser  </li>
        <li>Create a constructor in angular.<br>  |?|?|?|?|?  </li>
        <li> what provides backing logic in angular :<br> component ,ts </li>
        <li> what is data binding? :<br> two way data binding, model and view are always in sync  </li>
        <li> what do you understand by template interpolation  :<br> method by which we can use properties or methods from the backing logic of the component into the html views  </li>

        <li>https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/angularjs-interview-questions/ <br>  |?|?|?|?| </li>
        <li>Create class A and class B. Class B should inherit class A. Class B ke objects create karoo...<br> |?|?|?|?|?| </li>
        <li>ng new command <br>|?|?|?| </li>
        <li>ng generate component component name <br>|?|?|?|?|   </li>
        <li>Print 5 objects <br>?|?|?|?| </li>
        <li>Server machine pe angular installed h, apne client machine par angular application chalane ke liye, angular </li>
            jaruri h kya install hona on client side... :<br> NOT NEEDED, Angular website chalane k liye client side p nahi chiye </li>
        <li>Angular mai dependencies kaunsi kaunsi hoti h _______  </li>
        <li>Add 2 numbers dynamically and output should also be dynwmic<br>|?|?|?|?|?|</li>
        <li>What is loosely coupled languages :<br> in loosely, degree of dependencies bw two components is low.. loosely typed no need to declare variables  </li>
        <li>Why typescript is better than javascript  : <br>oops and bcoz we can easily debug, types are already known.. so code doesn't run ahead if there is problem there.. it shows compilation errors in development time  </li>
        <li> What are angular directives.... ______   </li>
        <li> why is node faster than java :<br> asynchronous and event driven   </li>
        <li>Why we use typescript? : <br>easy debugging, oops </li>
        <li> Employee table in angular : <br>|?|?|?|?| </li>
        <li> What are node and express? :<br> node is runtime environment, express is framework for backend application </li>
        <li> Difference between typescript and javascript :<br> one has types, other doesn't, typescript also has  oops  </li>
        <li> Event driven programming  : <br>//// </li>
        <li>What is interface ? :<br> a structure that defines syntax for classes... tells type for classes...type once defined can't be changed</li>
