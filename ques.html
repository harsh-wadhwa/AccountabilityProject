        <li> What are directives ? Types? Name some built in directives?   :  classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. DOM manipulation, type : component, structural, attribute...built in : ngstyle, ngclasses, ngmodel  </li>
        <li>Class vs interface ?  : objects of classes can be created, objects cant be created in interface... in class, interface can only be implemented using the keyword implement  </li>
        <li>Various components of angular? A component is a combination of view and backing logic
            app.component.ts provides backing logic, app.component.html and app.component.css files provide look and feel of app component
        </li>
        <li>What are dependencies and where are they present in angular? : 2 dependencies , development and production, development dependencies are packages which need during local development and testing time, production dependies are needed in production phase   </li>
        <li>DOM in javascript? : Document Object Model, in browser, html is converted into DOM </li>
        <li>What are components? _____   </li>
        <li>Class vs components?  A module in Angular 2 is something which is made from components, directives, services etc. One or many modules combine to make an Application. Modules breakup application into logical pieces of code. Each module performs a single task. Components in Angular 2 are classes where you write your logic for the page you want to display. Components control the view (html). Components communicate with other components and services.  </li>
        <li>What are constructors? : constructors are used to initialise the state of an object when object is being created </li>
        <li>What is polymorphism?  : Polymorphism is the ability to create a class that has more than one form. </li>
        <li>Function overloading vs function overriding? : |?|?||?|?|?|  </li>
        <li>Why should we use angular? : it is scalable, fixed component pattern, components can be reused.. and 2 way data binding  </li>
        <li>How to generate class and interface in angular : |?|?|?|?|?| </li>
        <li>Advantages of using nodejs : it is asynchronous, tasks can be done parallely, doesn't wait for other to finish,, provides runtime environment js, event driven approach</li>
        <li>Working of node js? </li>
        <li>What are functions? </li>
        <li>Where can we run javascript ?   </li>
        <li>Create a constructor in angular.    </li>
        <li> provides backing logic in angular  </li>
        <li> is data binding?   </li>
        <li> do you understand by template interpolation    </li>

            jaruri h kya install hona on client side... </li>
        <li>Angular mai dependencies kaunsi kaunsi hoti h   </li>
        <li>Add 2 numbers dynamically and output should also be dynwmic </li>
        <li> is loosely coupled languages   </li>
        <li>Why typescript is better than javascript    </li>
        <li> What are angular directives....    </li>
        <li> Why is no server side that's why its faster    </li>
        <li>Why we use typescript?  </li>
        <li> Employee table in angular  </li>
        <li> What are node and express? </li>
